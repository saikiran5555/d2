    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. The optimization problem in PCA involves finding the principal components (PCs) that capture the maximum variance in the data. These principal components are orthogonal linear combinations of the original features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the optimization problem in PCA works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the covariance matrix: The first step in PCA is to compute the covariance matrix of the data. The covariance matrix summarizes the relationships between pairs of features in the data and is crucial for determining the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalue decomposition: Next, we perform eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix to find its eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvectors represent the directions (principal components) along which the data varies the most, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select principal components: We select the top k eigenvectors (principal components) corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. These principal components capture the most significant sources of variation in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform the data: Finally, we project the original data onto the selected principal components to obtain the reduced-dimensional representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problem in PCA is trying to achieve dimensionality reduction while preserving as much of the variance in the data as possible. By selecting the principal components with the largest eigenvalues, PCA ensures that the reduced-dimensional representation retains the most important information from the original data. The ultimate goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while minimizing the loss of information, making it easier to visualize, analyze, and model the data.\n",
